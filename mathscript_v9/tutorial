20170222,
in this version, there is a new mode "quick_save_plot".
By this mode users do not need to set up " = PDFsetDir !", " = PDFsetmethod !" 
since the correlation data is stored in correlation_data.m 

what we need to setup:
"quick_save_plot = runfunc !"


" = figureDirtag !" set where to put the output figures
" = PDFname !" to set which PDFset users want to plot, presently only CT14nnlo is available
" = datalist !": the path of file "dat16lisformathematica"
" = expttype !" and " = exptid !": depend on users, deciding which experiments are plotted 

===========================
How we run:
math -script correlation_plot_project_v5_script.m

============================

1. the config file is replaced by a new version
2. work for smu workstation: curie, rubin (Mathematica 10.2)
3. explanation of new configure file for the web site:
presently, my Mathematica script only read following arguments, which means
functions or options for other arguments have not yet been workout:
PDF set:
Expt. ID:
Expt. Flag: 

"PDF set:" is the "PDFname" of old configure file.
"Expt. ID:" & "Expt. Flag:" are used to replace "= expttype !" & "= exptid !";
"Expt. ID:" show all possible experimental ID a web user can choose.
"Expt. Flag:" set 0 & 1 to control whether an ID of "Expt. ID" should be used 
as data for Mathematica.

---------------------------------
Checkboxes on the website
for "...Flag:" in config file,
we design checkboxes on website, if some boxes are checked, python should 
set those flags as 1, some that the Mathematica code will run these functions  

ex:
Figures to plot
x  Experimental data points
x  Experimental errors
x  Residuals
x  PDF errors on residuals
x  Correlations with functions
x  Histograms of correlations
x  Sensitivity to functions
x  Histograms of sensitivity
x  ...
---------------------------------
for other arguments in old configure file such as:
"= figureDirtag !"
"= datalist !"
I setup these paths in Mathematica code.
plots can be found in ./plots
datalist file could be found in the same Dir of Mathematica main code.
"= runfunc !"
web version only runs quicksaveplot mode, so users don't need to choose the run mode.
"= PDFsetDir !"
"= PDFsetmethod !"
"= PDFDataDir !"
same reason, quicksaveplot mode does not use these arguments
