Code I'm writing as an undergraduate physics research assistant at Southern Methodist University<br/><br/>

The webpage will provide lots of input fields for different variables, which when submitted will be passed to a Mathematica program that will generate a graph, and the graph will then be displayed.<br/><br/>

I am using the "Material Design Lite" framework from Google for making the input fields, and writing the backend using the Python CGI module.
