20170222,
in this version, there is a new mode "quick_save_plot".
By this mode users do not need to set up " = PDFsetDir !", " = PDFsetmethod !" 
since the correlation data is stored in correlation_data.m 

what we need to setup:
"quick_save_plot = runfunc !"


" = figureDirtag !" set where to put the output figures
" = PDFname !" to set which PDFset users want to plot, presently only CT14nnlo is available
" = datalist !": the path of file "dat16lisformathematica"
" = expttype !" and " = exptid !": depend on users, deciding which experiments are plotted 

===========================
How we run:
math -script correlation_plot_project_v5_script.m

============================
20170301
1. the config file is replaced by a new version
2. work for smu workstation: curie, rubin (Mathematica 10.2)
3. explanation of new configure file for the web site:
presently, my Mathematica script only read following arguments, which means
functions or options for other arguments have not yet been workout:
PDF set:
Expt. ID:
Expt. Flag: 

"PDF set:" is the "PDFname" of old configure file.
"Expt. ID:" & "Expt. Flag:" are used to replace "= expttype !" & "= exptid !";
"Expt. ID:" show all possible experimental ID a web user can choose.
"Expt. Flag:" set 0 & 1 to control whether an ID of "Expt. ID" should be used 
as data for Mathematica.

---------------------------------
Checkboxes on the website
for "...Flag:" in config file,
we design checkboxes on website, if some boxes are checked, python should 
set those flags as 1, some that the Mathematica code will run these functions  

ex:
Figures to plot
x  Experimental data points
x  Experimental errors
x  Residuals
x  PDF errors on residuals
x  Correlations with functions
x  Histograms of correlations
x  Sensitivity to functions
x  Histograms of sensitivity
x  ...
---------------------------------
for other arguments in old configure file such as:
"= figureDirtag !"
"= datalist !"
I setup these paths in Mathematica code.
plots can be found in ./plots
datalist file could be found in the same Dir of Mathematica main code.
"= runfunc !"
web version only runs quicksaveplot mode, so users don't need to choose the run mode.
"= PDFsetDir !"
"= PDFsetmethod !"
"= PDFDataDir !"
same reason, quicksaveplot mode does not use these arguments

=====================================
20170308
config file add new arguments
"Color by data percentage" allow user to input three number for percentage, ex: 40 65 90,
which means when you sort data from small to large, the position of the percentage in sorted data.
The percentage you choose seperate data by these percentage and give different color for these seprerated data in plots.

"Size" allow user to choose point size in plots
user could choose following sizes: tiny small medium large

"highlight mode" is for every plot type (presently from 1~7???)
user could choose different way to highlight the data range he want to see
#mode 0: No highlight. mode 1: highlight data by range of value. mode 2: highlight data by range of percentage
for mode 1: every plot type has 2 values, val1 val2, means highlight range of value of a data point,
ex: for "correlation" plots, 0.4  0.75 means data in (0.4,0.75) will be highlighted
for mode 2: val1 val2 are percentage
ex: for "correlation" plots, 40  75 means data in (40%,75%) will be highlighted

example for Mathematica code reading these arguments:
for following config file
Type:  1     2     3     4     5     6     7
Mode:  0     2     0     1     0     1     1
Mode 1 range: 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75
Mode 2 range: 50  86.55 50  86.55 50  86.55 50  86.55 50  86.55 50  86.55 50  86.55
 
code will read
Type:         1     2         3     4         5     6         7
Mode:         0     2         0     1         0     1         1
Mode 1 range: x  x  x   x     x  x  0.5  0.75 x x   0.5  0.75 0.5  0.75
Mode 2 range: x  x  50  86.55 x  x  x    x x  x x   x         x  x

(
since mode 0 does not hightlight data, so the code will not use value of mode 1&2 range,
when user choose any mode, for example mode 1, config still need to have value for other modes for read 
so that code will not show error message 
 )
============================
20170316
1. user option for #Functions to use in correlations set in program
2. size of point in highlight mode automatically set as small
3. make a meta_data_structure.txt file to record meta data in program
4. make a fake function of correlation to replace correlation function of library
(so that user mode corr, dr*corr can be calculated) 
5. I find the script version and the .nb version get little different outputs, 
for four plots combined in one by Grid function:
the .nb makes
A  B  plots
C  D 
script makes
A     plots
B
C  
D
     
========================
20170420
1. point size linearly enlarge in lighlighted region
2. deeper color for PDFCorrelationplot7 (Darker 0.1 -> 0.2)
