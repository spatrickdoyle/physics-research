20170222,
in this version, there is a new mode "quick_save_plot".
By this mode users do not need to set up " = PDFsetDir !", " = PDFsetmethod !" 
since the correlation data is stored in correlation_data.m 

what we need to setup:
"quick_save_plot = runfunc !"


" = figureDirtag !" set where to put the output figures
" = PDFname !" to set which PDFset users want to plot, presently only CT14nnlo is available
" = datalist !": the path of file "dat16lisformathematica"
" = expttype !" and " = exptid !": depend on users, deciding which experiments are plotted
