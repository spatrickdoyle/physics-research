#arguments:
#runfunc decides the function user want to run: runfun = save_fx, save_corr_plots 
#figureDir is the directory of figure files 
#PDFsetDir is the directory of PDFset, PDFsetmethod = Hessian or MC 
#PDFDataDir is directory store f(x,Q) data, PDFname is name of PDFset, ex: CT14NNLO 
#datalistFile is the file with experimental information 
#expttype & exptid are used to decide which experiments you want to show
